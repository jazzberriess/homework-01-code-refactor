# Code Refactor

## Description

Accessibility is an important aspect of web development that needs to be taken into consideration when building (or updating) a website.

This project was focussed on improving the accessibility of an already existing website. Not only does this increase usability for people using assistive technologies for their browsing, it also increases Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) for a website as well.

During this project I learned about semantic HTML elements, consolidating stylesheet properties and how to make a website more accessible for those using assistive technologies.
